# Chery-pick
git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch.
command - git cherry-pick commitId

# USECASE
If you by mistake make a commit in an incorrect branch, then using cherry-pick you can apply the required changes. 

# steps to do cherry-pick
1. create the two branches let branches are c1 and c2
command - git checkout -b c1 
        - git checkout -b c2
        
2. perform the commit on branch c1

3. now if we want that particular commit on branch c2 we will perform cherry-pick
command - git cherry-pick commit_ID
